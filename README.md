## Database Schema

The application uses an SQLite database to store user information, tasks, and categories. The database schema is as follows:

- **users**:
  - `id`: Primary key, auto-incremented.
  - `username`: Unique username.
  - `password`: Hashed password.
  - `email`: User's email.

- **tags**:
  - `id`: Primary key, auto-incremented.
  - `name`: Name of the category.
  - `description`: Description of the category.
  - `user_id`: Foreign key referencing the user who created the category.

- **tasks**:
  - `id`: Primary key, auto-incremented.
  - `title`: Title of the task.
  - `description`: Description of the task.
  - `status`: Status of the task (todo, completed).
  - `due_date`: Due date of the task.
  - `user_id`: Foreign key referencing the user who created the task.
  - `tag_id`: Foreign key referencing the category of the task.
  - `priority`: Priority of the task (1: low, 2: medium, 3: high).

## Security

- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are hashed using SHA-256 before being stored in the database.
- **Input Validation**: The application includes basic input validation to prevent common errors.
